## Beginning My iOS Development Adventure

Hello, curious minds! ðŸ‘‹

I've decided to dive into iOS development and learn **Swift**, Apple's powerful and intuitive programming language. My goal? To build my first app!

In this first lesson, I focused on the basics: **creating and setting up a new Xcode project**. Here's what I learnedâ€”and some extra fun stuff I explored along the way.

## Lesson 1: Create and Set Up a New Xcode Project

â–º I opened Xcode (after downloading it from the Mac App Store, of course) and clicked **"Create a New Xcode Project."**

- Selected **iOS > App** as the template.
- Filled in the project details:
  - **Product Name:** LOTRConverter (As the project it's going to be Lord of the Rings coin converter)
  - **Organization Identifier:** com.myusername (reverse domain style)
  - **Interface:** SwiftUI (I've heard it's more beginner-friendly!)
  - **Language:** Swift

âœ… **Success!** My project was created.

<br />

â–º Then I wanted to make my app visually appealing, so I learned how to add **assets**.

1. **Adding App Icons**

   - Went to `Assets.xcassets` > Right-click > **New iOS App Icon**.
   - Dragged and dropped appropriately sized PNGs into the slots.
   - Learned that Apple requires multiple sizes for different devices.

2. **Including Custom Images**
   - Created a new **Image Set** in `Assets.xcassets`.
   - Added my image files (ensuring I had @1x, @2x, and @3x versions for retina displays).

ðŸ’¡ _Pro Tip:_ Use [AppIcon Generator](https://appicon.co/) to quickly generate all required icon sizes!

## Bonus: Going Beyond the Basics

As usual, curiosity got the best of me, and I ended up exploring a few extra things:

â–º Connecting Xcode to GitHub (Source Control)

I wanted to back up my project, so I set up **Git version control** in Xcode.

- **Steps:**
  - Opened **Source Control Navigator** in Xcode.
  - Selected **"Create Git Repositories on My Mac"** to initialize a local repo.
  - Then, I linked it to **GitHub** by:
    - Going to **Xcode > Preferences > Accounts**.
    - Added my GitHub account using **"+" > GitHub**.

â–º Generating a GitHub Personal Access Token

Since Xcode no longer supports password authentication, I had to create a **Personal Access Token (PAT)**.

- Went to **GitHub > Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens**.
- Generated a new token with **repo** permissions.
- Used this token instead of a password when pushing to GitHub.

â–º Researching Which Files to Exclude from GitHub

I didn't want to clutter my repo with unnecessary files, so I Googled:

> _"Which files should I exclude when uploading an Xcode project to GitHub?"_

Turns out, I should **ignore**:

- `DerivedData/` (build artifacts)
- `.DS_Store` (macOS metadata)
- `*.xcuserstate` (user-specific settings)

I added these to a `.gitignore` file using a [Swift-specific template](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Swift.gitignore).

## Key Takeaways

- **Xcode setup is straightforward**, but asset management (icons, images) requires attention to detail.
- **GitHub integration** is super usefulâ€”version control from day one is a must!
- **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)** are now the way to authenticate with GitHub in Xcode.
- **.gitignore** helps keep the repo cleanâ€”don't upload unnecessary files!

## Next Steps

In **Lesson 2**, the plan is:

- Learn **SwiftUI basics** (Text, Buttons, Layouts).
- Experiment with **previews and live reloading**.
- ZStack
- VStack
- Break down screen design
- Lay out stacks
