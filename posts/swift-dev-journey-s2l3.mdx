## Understanding SwiftUI Stacks and Image Modifiers

Today, I dove deeper into SwiftUI and explored the powerful ways to structure layouts using **stacks**—specifically `ZStack`, `HStack`, and `VStack`. I also worked with images, learning how to resize and position them effectively. Here’s a breakdown of what I learned:

## The Three Key Stacks in SwiftUI

1. `HStack` **(Horizontal Stack)** – Arranges views side by side in a horizontal line.
2. `VStack` **(Vertical Stack)** – Stacks views vertically, one above the other.
3. `ZStack` **(Z-axis Stack)** – Layers views on top of each other, useful for overlapping elements.

We can see an example of this in this picture:

<br />

<div
  style={{
    display: 'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  }}
>
  <Image src="/images/ios-devjourney/stacks-vhz.png" width={750} height={550} />
</div>

<br />

## Working with Images

I also explored how to adjust images in SwiftUI using modifiers:

- **`.resizable()`** – Allows an image to scale to fit its container.
- **`.scaledToFit()`** – Maintains aspect ratio while fitting within bounds.
- **`.ignoresSafeArea()`** – Extends the view beyond the safe area (great for full-screen backgrounds).
- **`Spacer()`** – Pushes views apart, helping with flexible layouts.

An example would be:

<br />

```Swift
Image(systemName: "star.fill")
    .resizable()
    .scaledToFit()
    .frame(width: 100, height: 100)

```

<br />

## Last but not least: SF Symbols – A Handy Resource

I downloaded **SF Symbols**, Apple’s built-in icon library, which integrates seamlessly with SwiftUI. Using `Image(systemName:)`, we can easily add scalable, customizable icons to our apps.
